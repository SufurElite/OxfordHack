First World War
Bolshevik Revolution
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918)
Western Front Schlieffenplan: two front war, France then Russia. Russia mobilized faster than expected, and Germany did not knock France out Germany tried to stay static in the south while moving quickly in the north France holds them off at the Marne, leads to Race to the Sea. West becomes a stalemate Stalemate leads to expansion of the war to new fronts, more troops, deeper control of the economy, mobilizing the homefront using propaganda and hatred, mobilize minds and scholarship leading to new war tech Becomes war of attrition: maximum deaths on the other side, can accept staggering losses as long as you kill more of the enemy Britain blockades the central powers so that by 1916, as farming falls while people's needs rise, German/Austrian/Russian cities start starving
Development of war as a material contest, not a moral one. Men are a material.
Eastern Front Germany and A-H can push back the Russians starting 1915 w/ Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive Start seizing huge swaths of Russian territory, ethnically mixed. Large rural Jewish population
Key ideas: stalemate brings war into civilian life, economics of war blur line between homefront and warfront. State control of the media. Germany signs armistice
Tsar Nicholas wanted to raise morale by taking control of the army in 1915, except now Russia knew who to blame. By 1917, city people in Russia are starving February Revolution- soldiers refused to fire on citizens and joined the revolution International Women's Day: women started it asking for bread Parliament formed, Kerensky government Kerensky Offensive, July 1917: soldiers thought their officers in the backs and retreated Lenin stepped in to fill the vacuum Bolsheviks stayed out of government, had clean hands Lenin's new Marxism said no waiting to abandon the historical path, seize power with violence Armed rebellion on November 6+7 and Lenin takes over New foreign policy: all capitalist governments must be overthrown by force
Russia lost. Treaty that the Soviet Union signed with Germany, Austria Hungry, dictating the peace Turkish was written in Arabic until 1922, adopted Roman alphabet to show their secularity Established new nations carved out of the Russian empire Ukraine, Latvia, Poland, etc. Economic satellites for Germany/Austria-Hungry
 Treaty of Versailles, War Guilt and Reparations
Unrest, Revolution and Counterrevolution
With that peace, Germany could reroute troops from the East. All-out offensive in spring 1918 Germans quickly push Allies back to almost 1914 lines but are quickly exhausted and spread too thin in March 1918 US arrives, commanded by French and tactics developed by Brits Germany quickly overrun. Three months after promising conquered Russians food, they start losing Suddenness + censorship + propaganda means nobody thought they could lose
Germans had no foreign troops on their soil, were suing for peace rather than being conquered Versailles was one of five treaties ending WWI Versailles was first St. Germain Neuilly Trianon Sevres Jan 1919: 10,000 delegates from 32 countries discussed what peace terms would be dictated National self-determination: Woodrow Wilson proposes making countries "democratic" from his perspective Needed to create nation-states Started the idea of "unmixing" diverse communities to make issues less complicated: ethnic cleansing. When Germany surrenders, Brest-Litovsk goes away May/June 1919: Allies present their conditions to a German delegation who hasn't seen it before Shock and dismay, threatens to resign German admiral was supposed to turn ships over to UK, blows them up instead Delegation is blackmail into signing it on 28 June 1919 Schoolchildren during Weimar Republic are learning off of a map of Germany + what they lost Plebiscite: direct democracy where people could decide what country they wanted to join
Reparations and War Guilt Indemnity: penalty for losing Reparations: paying for damages caused Add in War Guilt, Article 231: Has to take all of the blame for WWI Have to wait until 1921 to come up with the bill: ends up $33 Billion Military limitations Emperor had abdicated so it was a parliamentary democracy who caught the blame
For Eastern Europe, war did not end in 1918. No peace. Organized, disorganized killing Russia's civil war 1917-1923 Greco-Turkish War, 1919-1922 (UK and France give permission to invade Turkey) 1.5 million displaced with ethnic cleansing, sanctioned by League of Nations Polish-Soviet War 1919-1920
 Auschwitz cont. Himmler designated it an additional extermination center "to kill Jews from the rest of Europe"
Reprisals- Destroying villages in response to rebellion Why did they kill people? No easy answer Construction of a moral system where there's an obligation to kill Racial understandings Whom did they kill? Jews Soviets Poles Romany people Homosexuals Political prisoners Whom did they spare? Scandinavians Italians/Spaniards By the Numbers 6 million Jews in Europe 3.5 million Soviet POW's 5-6 million Poles (including 3 million of the Jewish number) 250,000 Roma Up to 26 million Soviet Citizens 4.1 million famine deaths in occupied areas 1 million people during the siege of Leningrad Operation Reinhard Create killing centers near the ghettos Belzec (Lemberg) Sobibor (Lublin) Treblinka (Warsaw) Built by Jewish forced labor Heydrich invites SS leaders to Wannsee Conference to figure out logistics List of European countries with their Jewish populations Gas vans: no exhaust leaving the car, so on the drive to the camp the prisoners would die These camps were not run with cold efficiency Auschwitz: Why it's important to get it right Labor camp, POW camp, I. G. Farben (synthetic rubber) factory, German settlement, and a death camp that killed 1.1 million people Located in German-annexed Poland, camp for Polish labor Rain lines for three different empires converged Rudolf Hoss named commandant 10,000 Soviet POWs die building the extended camp, Auschwitz- BirkenauCollaboration 1. State-level collaboration 2. Individual collaboration 3. History, erasure, forgetting and rediscovery Example from Vienna: Nazis were very good at making Jews seem like they were never there
 Germany's Allies Croatia (1941-45) Kingdom of southern Slavs Nazis/Italians gave Croatian nationalists an opportunity to set up a puppet regime: Ustasa Regime Anti-Serb, Anti-Jewish, Anti-Romani Supported by Catholic church in Croatia Jasenovac death camp- murder of 100,000 of the undesirables Knives and clubs instead of gas Catholic priests participating in the executions Sisak- for children under 12 1945: Invasion of the Red Army, the Ustasa destroys records and camps 300,000 Serbs murdered in close personal fashion Goal of forcibly converting 200,000 to Catholicism 30,000 Jews 25,000 Romani (every single one in their territory) The Holocaust In Croatia- Goldstein Vichy France French government collapsed in 1940 and appointed WWI hero, Petain, as leader Traditionalist/arch-conservative, rejected much of the French democratic tradition Emphasized traditional values of work, family and patriotism (gendered) Promoted anti-Semitism Many middle-class Central European Jews had moved to France after persecution started Germany occupied the north and the coast but left the "French free state" in the south US recognized its "freedom" Technically responsible for civilian administration of the whole territory Did their best to protect French Jews but not immigrants Mainly concerned over citizenship, not race Scholars have called this idea more modern and liberal, but still allowed people to be rounded up and killed Romania Romania killed the most Jews other than Germany Did not put their quasi-Nazi party in power but worked with a conservative dictator, Ion Antonscu Repressed Jews at home Ghettos Looting and massacres of Jews during Barbarossa All backed by Orthodox clergy who claimed that the repression of the Jews was an Orthodox crusade Patriarch declared that it was "necessary to destroy the Jews" Occupied Odessa, 300,000+ died at the hands of the Romanian army
Adolf Eichmann on logistics Use of Zychlon B Created 4 crematoria (#2 could burn 4400 bodies a day) Still would break under strain How should we understand death camps? 5 camps account for 2.8 million people, we know we're missing another 3.2 million Local violence Mistakes along the way
 Unraveling the System Solar system- all of Europe falls into Germany's gravity Germany defines a hierarchy of humanity with themselves on top and the rest of Europe has to fit in Sowing chaos to allow people to access the worst of themselves Denazification Used by Allied powers to describe the removal of Nazis from positions of power US and Russia Re-education of German citizens A generation of kids taught Nazi ideals What pieces of culture need to be thrown out Nuremberg Trials -> mixed bag Soviets embarrassed by Katyn massacre Nazi leaders said they didn't know about death camps Legal basis of trial was shaky Crimes against humanity was a new concept Victor's retribution
Reeducation Soviet and Western zones proceed differently in this Policies evolved during Cold War Americans- Questionnaire 131 questions meant for EVERY German adult Create 5 categories of people, things from losing your job to prison Deputized German agencies to handle the questionnaire Categorized people who were "brainwashed" and gave them amnesty People could pretty easily lie If the agency judged that you were clear, you were washed clean of Nazism "Persilscheine" laundry detergent Unpopular option Politics in the German Occupation Zones Soviets allow political parties at first Start tightening down US and British don't want to have to work with local politicians Gradually open up Extremes suppressed (Communists) 3 major blocs emerge: Social Democrats on left, Christian Democratic Union (Catholic/Protestant center), and the Free Democratic Party (combo of pro-market liberalism and national conservatism)
Emerging Cold War Partition of Germany The Western Zones (US, Britain and France) come together to form one nation Cold War ended denazification
Locked in barns and barns were set on fire Refused to participate in deportations to death camps
 The Frankfurt-Auschwitz Trial Fritz Bauer- escapee of the Holocaust, became attorney general in Hesse, was the one who found Eichmann Unpopular because the government was predominantly Nazi How to try the people who ran Auschwitz? 1. Executive Administration (Mulka, second in command) i. Claimed he didn't know that gassing was taking place, it wasn't pertinent to his job 2. Protective Custody Leadership 3. Camp Gestapo 4. Camp Medical Service 5. Kapos- Jewish inmate who helped Had 24, convicted 17 Bauer found dead in his bathtub in '68 three years after the trial finishedPostwar Austria and Forgetting Austria had been annexed in 1938 7.5 million Austrians had become German citizens Fully incorporated into German empire 9% of German population Served in SS (higher proportions worked in death camps) German Army Gestapo
1951: West German parliament passes the Reinstatement Act to allow former Nazis to have service jobs The strings of the Marshall Plan $150 billion in European Economic Recovery Plan US sorta forces German banks to link in with other European banks Linked currencies Integrated production, move away from autarky In contrast, Soviet-dominated east was not allowed to take advantage of opportunities Central-planned economies East and West Germany established in 1948-49 West Germany running itself Federalism with new states Social market economy- regulated free market capitalism New "Basic Law" - "Human dignity is inviolable." German Democratic Republic (East Germany) One-party dictatorship Planned economy Soviet paternalism One singular milieu First person elected to lead Germany since Hitler: Konrad Adenauer Coalition Government Built a coalition with right-wing parties because he hated Social Democrats Stopped extreme ring-wing politics by integrating and taming Normalized employing former Nazis Worked closely with Western Allies (close with US) Saw increased prosperity and return to normal Food, consumerism, tourism, 1954 World Cup
 Small resistance, many were killed Bombed, raped and occupied by Allied troops Experience was fundamentally the same as Germans Moscow Declaration- Austria was the first victim of Hitler's aggression By 1955, Allies agreed to withdraw and let Austria be independent Agreed upon by all victors Austria is neutral, can't be in NATO or Warsaw Pact A bridge between East and West Had to figure out what an Austrian was: couldn't go with the definition from Austro-fascists (better Germans) Allies helped create the new identity
Bruno Kreisky Chancellor 1970-83, after Auschwitz and Eichmann trials Jewish Social Democrat Imprisoned by Austro-Fascist regime for being a socialist, next door to Nazis Fled to Sweden 1938, missed persecutions Returned in '46, established as one of the heads of the party Very pro-Austrian chancellor, pushed back against Israel about Nazis in his government Wiesenthal Affair ('75) Simon Wiesenthal was a Nazi hunter, exposing former Nazis Friedrich Peter was the leader of "Freedom Party", liberals in Austria Kresiky wasn't sure if he could win a majority, was in talks with the party Wiesenthal reported that Peter had been a commander of an Einsatzgruppe Kreisky criticized Wiesenthal for shitting on his own country Tried to launch a federal investigation of the Jewish Documentary Center Waldheim Affair Austrian diplomat in '45, elected Secretary General in '72, ran for president of Austria Press found out he committed war crimes in Croatia
 Early 1920's Germany: they're paying reparations instead of creating social programs and welfare
Civil Wars and Paramilitary Violence
Context for founding a new parliamentary democracy
Hyperinflation and economic dislocations
Poland fights 6 wars between 1918-1920 Takes territory from German, Lithuania, Austria, Russia and threatens Czechoslovakia
Czechoslovakia: founded 1918 out of the Hapsburg empire, democratic nation state of the two groups By its own foreign policy was treated as an Ally even though they fought on the Central side Czech are the largest language group, Germans are the second Huge number of German-speaking Jewish towns Germans felt that national self-determination was used to screw them over
From Finland in the north to the collapsing Ottoman Empire in the south, most of Europe was still destroying itself Freikoprs in formerly German areas of the east asked to help defeat Bolsheviks in the Baltics Latvia, Lithuania, Poland Paramilitary, ex-vets mobilized as a volunteer force Led to huge massacres Green Cadres: roaming bandits Invasion of Croatian city of Fiume by Italian nationalist 41% of Poland in 1921 doesn't speak Polish Creates economic dislocation From 3/4 empires in the east to like a dozen nation states with new boundaries, trade restrictions, towns cut off from food and peasants from markets Self-help instead of trade and cooperation is the policy
Germany needs money to stabilize, pay reparations, pay for war, create social programs
November 1918: Kaiser Wilhelm abdicates, German parliament passed a law making themselves the responsible party and declares Germany a republic Elected in 1912, largest party was the social democrats (party of the working class) Were not very revolutionary, kind of just left of center Left conservative bureaucrats in power, people who swore oaths to the emperor Bad blood between social democrats and communists Weimar Constitution signed into law August 1919 Two months after treaty of Versailles Not revolutionary, little bit of social welfare Can't be done without money Prime minister and then a president who has a lot of the functions of the emperor Prez can dissolve them and call new elections, also keeps power to declare state of emergency and rule by decree (with the same weight as laws)
 20 million Catholics (30%ish of population), many high ranking Nazis were Catholics (Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, etc) Parishes were hard to break (school, women's clubs, charity) ICYMI: Center Party disbanded when Hitler signed a Concordat (treaty) with the Pope Thought that would mean Hitler left them alone Wrong Hitler Youth would do camping and hiking trips on weekends to pull them away from the Church Catholicism as inherently Jewish (Alfred Rosenberg, The Myth of the 20th Century) Resistance was focused on trying to protect their own, not saving the world or saving Germany Also believed in treating converted Jews with respect
Taxes to pay allies = political suicide Create loose currency policy to aid inflation, think it could make the recovery faster Spirals out of control in 1922-23, falling behind in reparations and coal November 1921: $1 = 263 marks Mid 1922: 493 marks August 22: 1000 marks October: 3000 marks December: 7000 marks December 1923: 4,200,000,000,000 marks Demolished savings France responds by invading the Ruhr Valley (most dense industrial area) Germany then tells all of its miners to stop working Send care packages of printed money to help the striking workers Currency becomes meaningless, hyperinflation sets in Germany starts creating propaganda that claims France is using African troops, very racist anti- French Get paid in cash in a wheelbarrow, try to buy as much non-perishable food and pay for rent because prices rose by the hour Don't believe in money or the state
EFFECTS: Crime wave, theft and barter economy Violence against persons increased (raiding the countryside to eat) Decline in morals? Bourgeois/middle class values under threat?
Lots of Protestant ministers embraced nationalism/Nazism Considered Germany a protestant state, Catholic minority was a problem German Christian movement: pro-Nazi movement with 600,000 by 1933 Declared aim was to oppose the Jewish mission in Germany, reject the spirit of Christian cosmopolitanism and to fight racial mixing Develop of form a Christianity that fit in with their emphasis on race Pastor's Emergency League opposed them: led by Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemoller 6000 pastors, theologians/intellectual wing, Bible study focusing on religion not race Fight only for Jewish converts, not for the Jewish people
QUARANTINE ------- STOPPED TAKING NOTES
 For children, manipulating schools/after school clubs/social scene Extra emphasis on history, biology, physics Teachers under NSLB (Nazi teachers) Paid teachers not much, subjected surveillance, Old Brownshirts joined the facultyRecap: For children, manipulating schools/after school clubs/social scene Extra emphasis on history, biology, physics Teachers under NSLB (Nazi teachers) Paid teachers not much, subjected surveillance, Old Brownshirts joined the faculty Nazis are creating an education crisis so they're trying to reach the young directly Dissolve rival clubs of the Hitler youth 8.7 out of 8.87 million German kids between 10-18 who were members (98%) Instilling traditional gender roles Surveillance of their parents, inserting a wedge
Nazi German as a "racial state" Racial science: physical anthropology (color of hair, skull shape) Hitler made appointments of professorships in racial hygiene as early as '33 Field of science for 40/50 years before Nazi takeover Positive vs. negative eugenics: breeding in versus breeding out Negative eugenics begin in '33, compulsory sterilization for disease/deformity, alcoholism Doctors had to report them to the authorities Sterilization was dangerous 360,000 between '33-39 under that law IMPORTANT: Nazi racial politics are conforming to 30+ years of racial science, 20 or more states in U.S. had similar laws Most sterilizations are being performed on people who were technically "Aryan Germans" Nazis cast the disabled as a threat while encouraging childbirth for women Attacking feminism and women's emancipation New organization- Nazi Women's League Encourage abortion in Jews while forbidden for women From 35,000 in '31 to less than 2,000 in '39 Death of the family Public accolades, ceremonies for mothers Medals! Uncle Hitler! Expanded grounds for divorce (sterile, infertile) "Lifespring" were houses for unwed, racially pure mothers to help them raise their children This naturally creates a reason to invade: living space and food
Targeting groups Romani/Gypsies- from what we know, migrants from North India beginning of 1500's (Aryans are from there too..?) Seen as outsiders, lived outside of cities and towns performing menial work
Post 1935: tightening the screws, shutting down organizations, didn't like the level influence that priests had Leaked criminal investigations about money laundering and sex abuse Gestapo sent agents into parishes as informers Clamped down on all type of schooling unless embraced Nazi values
 Nuremburg Laws: End of the "muted persecution" Jews weren't targeted the same way as those groups: not a burden but an enemy (malicious and wily) Connections to a worldwide conspiracy Lead-up to the Nuremberg Laws '35: Gestapo reporting that people want change, Hitler unleashes the brownshirts to coordinate boycotts accompanied by property damage and violence The laws- Riechs Flag Law Swastika as flag, idea that Jews would not be allowed to provoke Germans into "righteous" attacks Reich Citizenship Law Citizens are only German or kindred blood, only they had political rights. All others were subjects of the state with no rights Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor Prohibited marriage and sex between Jewish and Germans, provided easy annulmentsReading Mazower Moving from interpersonal to "from the moon" history Imperialism and colonialism- flaunting the "rules" of occupation Recruiting and enslavement Zooming back out to Nazi relationship with the rest of Europe
Preparing for war Nazi policy before '36 was about rebuilding industry Autarky: a closed in-country system that's self-sufficient After '36 was about rebuilding arms (at the expense of a growing economy) Less autarky, bullying big business into making weapons Contradictions in policy and goals Leaving women in the home versus importing labor? By '38 the government has brought in 500,000 foreign workers (mostly Italians) Pact between Mussolini and Hitler, propaganda machine
Weren't citizens of any particular place Labelled as a criminal race, considered "work shy" and lazy Full-blooded were considered harmless, it was mixed breeding that Nazis objected to Forced into camps, given identity cards Rhinelandbastarde- children of French colonial (black) troops and German women (1919-23) Few in number (>1000) and easily identifiable Popular unsubstantiated claims that they were all product of rape Symbolized German defeat in WWI Forced sterilization (often with mother's permission) Homosexuals- illegal in Germany since its found in 1800's Nazis altered criminal code in '35 to outlaw "unnatural sex act" Believed that only 1-2% were really homosexuals, rest could be changed Making an example of 1936 - Reich office for the Combatting of Homosexuality and Abortion 5000-15000 men between '33-5 imprisoned in concentration camp About 50% died in camp from informal violence committed by guards
 The Anschluss (A Connection) Austria after '33 was authoritarian state (Catholic Corporatism or Clerical Fascism) Closely allied with the Catholic Church Three main parties after WWI: German Nationalist, Social Democrats (more Marxist and radical than in Germany), and the Christian Social Party German Nationals were too small so it was really a battle between the two Christian Socials won (Blacks) won, crushed the socialist uprising Declared one-party state, outlaw/imprison/expel the Nazis and the Marxist Created by Engelbert Dollfuss (assassinated by Nazis '34) Succeeded by Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg, who outlaws Nazis and Socialists Turns to Italy for protection Economic troubles from the Great Depression Rising sentiment of joining Germany Ends up in Dachau for 6 years before emigrating to US (taught at SLU) Pressure from Hitler after '36 1936 Agreement: Austria is a German state, forced to incorporate Nazis into the government (even though they're banned) "Wild Nazis": Austrian Nazis who are "rabid" and not under Hitler's control (terrorism) February '38: Hitler and Schuschnigg meet at Hitler's residence Forced a joint foreign policy Legalization of the Austrian Nazi Party Release of Nazis from imprisonment Economic and military collaboration Nazi politician appointed as Interior minister Schuschnigg was going to stage a referendum for March 13, so Hitler invades that morning Cheering crowds of 450,000+
Appeasement and the Munich Agreement Interwar Czechoslovakia: By '33, 66% of the unemployed were German (30% of population) Hitler uses Goebbels to create a fake "Czech annihilation" of Germans that he needs to go fight Chamberlain: "a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing" Goering offers a peace agreement behind Hitler's back, Italy then formally requests it from Hitler September '38: Munich agreement that Germany will occupy and annex the German rim of Czechoslovakia
Bottom line: war needs to come sooner Rearmament: army will need to increase to 550K (100K limit from Treaty of Versailles) Reintroduction of general military service 1936: Axis Pact with Italy Italian invasion of Ethiopia prompts it Remilitarization of the Rhineland, March '36 Huge propaganda effort Plebiscite referendum, had a 99% approval Spanish Civil War: Germans practice with their new bombers Bombing of Guernica '37 Lebensraum- In order to win future wars, the Germans are going to need more living space
 Euthanasia Programs SS were already writing in public journals about "life unworthy of life" Many members were physicians who advocated as early as '36 for "involuntary euthanasia" Transformation from committee on sterilization to committee on killing Headed by Karl Brandt to kill mentally or physically handicapped children September '39- Meeting of Hitler's chancellery, 20 doctors attended to organize the killing and extend to adults Order by Hitler to grant "merciful death" to those "incurable" Compulsory registration of all "malformed" newborn children. Doctors/nurses paid 2 marks for every name on the list Children removed from home and taken to "specialist clinics" were they were killed by neglect or medication Continued through the war and killed about 5000 children/babies Doctors believed they were restoring balance to nature via natural selection Care should go to soldiers, the healthy The T-4 Operation: expanding the program to adults Viktor Brack organized the registration, transport, personnel and budget of involuntary euthanasia Knew they would need to avoid suspicion, larger numbers (70,000+) Doctors come up with the idea for carbon monoxide poisoning Gas chamber prototype built December '39 Process took about 2 hours Chambers built at "T-4 Program Centers," 4 or so run at a time through July '41 Long-term care required to send lists to Berlin Picked up at hospital, put on bus, brought to new facility and first thing was a "shower"
No CZSLV reps there Hitler gets all the credit for avoiding war and bringing in 3 million new Germans, huge public success October '38: Hitler marches troops into the new areas to cheering crowds About 20,000 Jews flee (about 2,000 remain) Seems that Germany and Italy are the only countries who can revise the Paris Peace agreement which everyone thinks is broken anyway Leads to new Allies who also want revised borders Poland just takes a piece of land, Hungary demands all of Slovakia Early '39: Hitler turns eye towards Danzig and Lithuanian Memel (German-speaking areas) March '39: Hitler invades Czech republic and Morava (middle) to "protect them" Slovakia becomes an ally of Nazi Germany, follows Austrofacist model and is led by a Catholic priestPieces of our narratives: (1) Barbarossa- Invasion of the Soviet Union, August 1941. (2) Wannsee Conference- Decision to start the Holocaust. January 1942. Usually cast as straightforward and obvious, but we're going to unpack Challenge the logic of war-> Holocaust Not the war but a series of moral failures and decisions that began before the war, the war and the decisions evolved together Murder of Jews connected to murder of others but distinctive
 Invasion of Poland- September 1st 1939 French expressed outrage but did nothing German had all new equipment Engaging in a new kind of war, civilians as collateral damage Germany poured everything into defeating Poland quickly, if west had responded it coulda been good Soviet Union invaded on Sept. 17, make Molotov-Ribbentrop pact splitting the country German and Russian casualties low compared to Polish Occupation regime in Poland shows German intentions and lebensraum Population removal or murder, looting, squashing culture, slave labor. All already present in '39 Only considered human beings insofar as they could work for the regime Long term prejudice against Poles Hitler planned in the invasion to kill as many Poles as possible Poland was never completely pacified, Germans frequently died trying to enforce the rules Divided into three parts: added some to existing provinces, created new provinces, and then made the "General Government" General gov given to Hans Frank, Himmler wanted to get rid of him in Germany A colony outside of the German empire and beyond its law Run as state of emergency all the time, where Germans would learn to fight the racial wars of hard ethnic struggle German army moves in first and then brings in SS "Special Task Forces" to pacify resistance Gangs roving and murdering people Books burned Closed universities and high schools Used the area as a racial dumping ground 3 million in the first year and a half
People with gold teeth were marked so that orderlies could recover the valuables Murdered 80,000 people or so Close connections among special needs families started figuring stuff out Pastor Bodelschwingh refused to turn patients over, the regional leader of the Nazi party refused to arrest him for fear of uprising Nazis bomb his hospital and blame the British Pastor Braune organized a meeting with Brack to call him out Brack doesn't admit to anything, so Braune writes Hitler personally assuming that Hitler doesn't know Braune arrested by the Gestapo and told to shut up and comply, and he did Bishop Clemens August von Galen, the bombed hospital was in his diocese Told frequently that it wasn't worth it, other bishops pled his silence Used T-4 program as a way of attacking the regime which was bullying his diocese Openly mentions the T-4 program in homilies, conflict with government escalates Sent open letter to public prosecutor Successfully got the T-4 program closed in '41 Nazis learn from the T-4 program about efficiency, isolation
 Sitzkrieg/Phony War German invades and takes over Denmark in 105 minutes, invades Norway Britain intervenes, Hitler blows up German fleet, Chamberlain steps down for Churchill USSR fights Finland, does not go well German invades France with tanks in May 1940 Petain takes over in June,
Operation Barbarossa: June 1941 Hitler takes over a huge chunk of the Soviet Union Into the East: The Nazi State and Settler Colonialism Frank and Himmler redefine "colonialism" to mean specifically replacing the populations there with Germans Lemkin: "a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups" Phase One- Destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group Phase Two- Imposition of the national pattern of the oppressors Wiping out a group's presence General Plan East: Formulated in '41, brought to Hitler in '42 Displace 60 million people and create three settlements across the east Splitting the general government into 5 provinces, including Lublin Testing ground- 60,000 new Germans into the province ('41-'42) 100,000 villagers expelled Ran into issues during their test Difficult to set up the idealized farms Couldn't find 60,000 Germans to bring there Operation Barbarossa (named after Frederick 1 Holy Roman Emperor) June 22,1941 3 million men in 150 divisions, accompanies by 30 divisions of Romanian and Finnish 3000 tanks, 7000 pieces of artillery, 2500 aircraft Behind the German lines were the Einsatzgruppen, the SS Special Task Units
Nazi Germany and Systematized Murder How did they kill people? Not just gas chambers Most killings were inefficient Shooting Long days, psychological suffering of perpetrators Heydrich rationalized the process: "clear out the Ghettos to make room for deportations" "Natural' death with disease, malnourishment, etc. Death by labor Collaboration- convincing people to kill each other Rewriting the narrative that the Nazis killed everyone themselves
Katyn Massacre: March 1940, Stalin orders the deaths of 25,700 prisoners Officers, police, officials, priests Ghettoization of Poland's Jews, 1940 Big ones in Lodz and Warsaw 445,000 people into about 1.5 square miles
