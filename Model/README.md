# Model
The model that I implemented can be found here: https://github.com/holylovenia/question-answer-generation. I have previously read through papers on QA and QG, which lead me to the idea of this project (the Flashcard generator), but in order for this flashcard generator to work a question and answer pair generator is needed. And this model goes about achieves the result, similar to how I had envisioned (albeit slight differences). The inspiration for both this project and the model was as detailed in the associated paper: 
_"In this present study, we aim to focus on generating question-answer pairs for academic purposes. This is motivated by the disadvantages of using the conventional way to produce question-answer pairs related to a certain text, which is considered time-consuming and reptitive. Given the need for QAG without human efforts in the academic field, our main objective in the present study is to build an automaitc QAG system as an authoring aid to produce answers and the related questions based on a short reading comphrension passage"_
I have forked their github repository, which dates back to 2018 but hasn't been updated for 10 months, and I eagerly look forward to trying to modify the present model architecture, so as to encompass more subject territory (i.e. not only limited to comphrension passages) and look into the future work they had listed in the paper (namely, a more robust implementing an already established rule-based question generation system,implementing a deep neural network for question generation itself - e.g. a Seq 2 Seq network).
