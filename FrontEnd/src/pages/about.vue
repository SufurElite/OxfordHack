    <f7-block-title>About Flashy Cards</f7-block-title>
    <f7-block strong>
      <p>As a student in high school, I found flashcards to be an integral part to studying and would develop these flashcards for almost all my subjects, but, upon entering college, I had an increased workload, a job, and little time to spare on creating flashcards.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with my interests in Natural Language Processing, this problem lead me to think more about utilising a Question and Answering model to generate Flashcards. </p>

    <f7-block strong>
      <p>Hence, Flashy Cards! A mobile application that generates the Flash Cards for you to use, so you don't have to spend the time creating them yourself and have more time to revise.</p>
      <p>Currently, it is primarily applicable to reading comprehension based subjects but soon to also incorporate vocabulary for learning languages!</p>
